                                    Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain
                                    mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches. Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science,
                                    structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aideddesign (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to
                                    design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices , weapons, and others.

                                    Mechanical engineering emerged as a field during the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th century; however, its development can be traced back several thousand years around the world. In the 19th century, developments in physics led to the development
                                    of mechanical engineering science. The field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements; today mechanical engineers are pursuing developments in such areas as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It
                                    also overlaps with aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, industrial engineering, and other
                                    engineering disciplines to varying amounts. Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, biomechatronics, bionanotechnology, and modelling
                                    of biological systems.

                              UC3M offers a fundamental course on the history of space exploration with its class, The Conquest of Space, offered through edX partnerships. You'll learn the very beginnings of space exploration, including Sputnik and Apollo missions, Voyager, and the space missions happening now. You'll even learn how Virgin Galactic and other spaceflight systems could soon rocket us all into the stars. Arizona State University has a credit-eligible course, Introductions to Solar Systems Astronomy. Here, you'll learn about celestial bodies and other features of space, including supermassive black holes, meteorites, supernovas, and neutron stars. If you've ever been held captive by Saturn's rings or the beauty of gamma-ray bursts, this course gives you everything you need to know. Cal Tech's The Evolving Universe is another introductory course for those with interest in all things space. It covers the features of interstellar space and our known universe, including dark matter, the big bang, and physics observations.</p>
                            <p>As more companies like Blue Origin and thinkers like Elon Musk push for humanity's expansion to the stars, you could find yourself in a lucrative career position. Even if you don't pursue a career, it's in our blood to be fascinated by exploration, so feed that natural curiosity with courses from EdX and continue to find wonder. The next time you look into the night sky, you'll have the knowledge you need to stay interested. Someday, thanks to our ceaseless need for exploration, you may look up to see the first starliner going overhead — quite a journey for humanity.</p>

                                History tends to be well respected by employers as a challenging academic subject, and the analytical skills it develops could lead to a career in an area such as education or law.
                                History degrees offer a good intellectual challenge and are well respected by employers. If you want a career that directly relates to history, you’re likely to need to take further qualifications and gain substantial voluntary experience after you graduate. However, there are plenty of other job areas you can go into that offer a more straightforward career path.
                                In the first year your choice of modules will probably be limited. Modules are often broad, covering long periods of history and wide ranges of topics. You’ll probably need to study both medieval and modern history. If you go to university in Scotland, where most degrees last four years, it’s likely that this broad approach will continue into your second year – and that you’ll be expected to study other subjects as well as history in your first two years.

                              Individuals who have graduated in product design can look for jobs in various industries, multinational companies, and even in thriving businesses who are constantly dealing with design and creation or manufacturing of various products. The advantage of this course study is that in completion of the course individuals can open their own business and start selling and designing their products.
                              This course is usually pursued by business-oriented individuals with a keen interest in setting up their own business. If they want to pursue higher studies at the postgraduate level, they will even have more opportunities in India as well as abroad among multinational companies.
                              The scope offered by this course is the main reason for pursuing the course degree. The undergraduate level may not have many opportunities with high paying jobs from prestigious companies. However, individuals with a master’s degree in product design may get many job offers from prestigious companies in India and abroad.

                                    Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems,
                                    pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways. Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society, and its history is intricately linked to advances
                                    in the understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history. Because civil engineering is a broad profession, including several specialized sub-disciplines, its history is linked to knowledge of structures, materials
                                    science, geography, geology, soils, hydrology, environmental science, mechanics, project management, and other fields. Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the
                                    second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering, and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal
                                    public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.

                                Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.

                                Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science.[a]
                                
                                Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering or electronic engineering. Practising engineers may have professional certification and be members of a professional body or an international standards organization. These include the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) (formerly the IEE).
                                
                                Electrical engineers work in a very wide range of industries and the skills required are likewise variable. These range from circuit theory to the management skills of a project manager. The tools and equipment that an individual engineer may need are similarly variable, ranging from a simple voltmeter to sophisticated design and manufacturing software.

                                Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

                                Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing.
                                
                                Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures.

                                Graduates of University of Maryland’s Computer Science Department are lifetime learners; they are able to adapt quickly with this challenging field.
                              </p>
                              Computer science is considered as part of a family of five separate yet interrelated disciplines: computer engineering, computer science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering. This family has come to be known collectively as the discipline of computing.
                              <p>
                                 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                The major subfields of computer science include the traditional study of computer architecture, programming languages, and software development. However, they also include computational science (the use of algorithmic techniques for modeling scientific data), graphics and visualization, human-computer interaction, databases and information systems, networks, and the social and professional issues that are unique to the practice of computer science.

                              Software engineering pertains to building and developing 
                              intangible products for today's modern world. We routinely
                              use software to accomplish everyday tasks like online banking,
                               messaging friends, storing files in the cloud, and so much more 
                               which an engineer built. If you've been wondering how to learn 
                               software engineering, you've come to the right place.

                              A software engineer is a person who designs, tests,
                               maintains, and evaluates the software that they've built.
                                Software engineers work with businesses, governments, hospitals,
                                 non-profits, and more organizations and companies to develop the
                                  software they need to run correctly. A software engineer needs to
                                   understand the desires of their clients, so they typically work with
                                    project managers, customer service, account managers, and more to develop 
                                    the best software for them.</p>

                            Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming,
                             advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning
                              with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights
                               hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide
                                decision making and strategic planning.
                                The accelerating volume of data sources, and subsequently data, has 
                                made data science is one of the fastest growing field across every industry.
                                 As a result, it is no surprise that the role of the data scientist was dubbed 
                                 the “sexiest job of the 21st century” by Harvard Business Review
                                  (link resides outside of IBM).Organizations are increasingly reliant on 
                                  them to interpret data and provide actionable
                                   recommendations to improve business outcomes.</p>

                    <em> Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree </em>
                    is designed to provide in-depth knowledge of a wide-range of
                    aspects related to business operations. The program's core
                    curriculum typically covers topics, such as accounting,
                    marketing, finance, and more. The degree degree can take up
                    to four years or more to cover at a traditional college, but
                    can be earned much faster in an accelerated program. As a
                    graduate, you could possess critical thinking skills and
                    practical knowledge of one or more areas of specialty. The
                    program aims to provide you with an opportunity to learn

                    <em> Business and commerce </em>
                    is the exchange of goods or services among two or more parties.
                     It is the subset of business that focuses on the sale of finished
                      or unfinished products rather than their sourcing, manufacturing,
                       transportation, or marketing.
                      Generally, commerce can refer to an exchange of goods or services 
                      for money or something of equal value.
                      From the broadest perspective, governments are tasked with managing 
                      the commerce of their nations in a way that meets the needs of their
                       citizens by providing jobs and producing beneficial goods and services.

                    <em> Accounting </em>
                    is one of the backbones of the modern world, and the backbone
                     of business. Behind every successful company is a skilled accountant 
                     – who understands how to use their knowledge of finance, mathematics,
                      statistics, and economics to grow a business.
                       Accounting is a highly specialised subject, but is about much
                        more than just numbers. It looks specifically at the daily flow of
                         money in and out of a business, keeping an eye on the balance and 
                         avoiding any future challenges.

                    <em> Financial Engineering </em>
                    Financial engineering is the use of mathematical techniques
                     to solve financial problems. Financial engineering uses tools
                      and knowledge from the fields of computer science, statistics,
                       economics, and applied mathematics to address current financial
                        issues as well as to devise new and innovative financial products.
                        Financial engineering is sometimes referred to as quantitative analysis
                         and is used by regular commercial banks, investment banks, insurance agencies, 
                         and hedge funds.
                         The financial industry is always coming up with new and innovative investment 
                         tools and products for investors and companies. Most of the products have been
                          developed through techniques in the field of financial engineering. Using mathematical
                           modeling and computer science, financial engineers are able to test and issue new tools
                            such as new methods of investment analysis, new debt offerings, new investments,
                             new trading strategies, new financial models, etc.

                  <h4 class="card-title">WHAT IS IT ABOUT ENGINEERING?</h4>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Engineering is the application of science and maths to solve
                    problems. Engineers figure out how things work and use for
                    scientific discoveries. Scientists and inventors often get
                    credit for innovations that advance human condition, but it
                    is the engineers who are instrumental in making these
                    innovatons available to the global population. Engineering
                    is one of the corner stones of STEM(science, technology,
                    engineering, mathematics) education, an interdisciplinary
                    curriculum designed to motivate students to learn about the
                    evolving world. A career in engineering requires continual
                    professional development to remain relevant and effective in
                    today's rapidly changing global society. There are currently
                    more than 15 million engineers across various disciplines
                    worldwide and with the surge in technological advancements
                    and preparedness, anyone can be a part of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineering spreads over multiple fields such as
                    bio-engineering to the more common mechanical engineering
                    courses. Engineering is a hands-on course that relies more
                    on practicality and not theory based studies. However,
                    engineering optons such as software engineering offer the
                    rare pleasure of being a mind based field where traditional
                    college institutions as well as highly-acclaimed online
                    programmes strive to provide high grade content and
                    knowledge. All is not lost though, since engineering favours
                    both the active and passive. An engineering degree takes
                    upto tho 5 years to acquire whereas the masters and PhDs
                    take 2 years each.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To successfully design and engineer solutions for today's
                    and tomorrow's rapidly changing and expanding global
                    contexts, in which people are confronted with new
                    opportunities and challenges each day, engineering programs
                    should be training their students to become broad based
                    professionals, who are aware of the actual needs, values and
                    behaviors of the people that use their solutions in their
                    everyday life, work or play. This paper argues that in order
                    to built such an awareness, engineering students should
                    acquire direct, first-hand experiences of real people in
                    real contexts. It presents a number of techniques that can
                    be used to gain such experiences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Engineering opens a learner up to greater heights with the
                    right skills and mindset. It is important to point out that
                    engieering experiences an influx of aspiring students each
                    and every year making it a highly competitive field where
                    the resilient and committed survive to emerge on top.
                    However, don not forget to have fun while you are at it. The
                    field enables you to interact with new technology and people
                    with various banks of knowledge to offer in your journey

                                    Home Economics offers a range of exciting career options related to foods, nutrition, housing and clothing. Most home economists teach in various types of educational institutions.

                                <p>
                                    Some work closely with the media to promote products. Others conduct research in an area of personal interest in this field. Most home economists supervise at least one other employee.

                                    Counselling: home economics counselling is given informally and is aimed at developing every family member within the family’s income and their physical, mental and intellectual abilities. Individuals, organizations and associations are provided with
                                    information by means of projects and demonstrations, posters, audio-visual aids, pictures, pamphlets, placards, cookbooks, etc.

                                    Journalism: the press, radio and television offer interesting opportunities for a person who is original and creative. The home economist may become a journalist on a full-time, part-time or freelance basis. Many home economists write books or columns
                                    for newspapers and magazines.
                                </p>

                                    Home economists work in a very large variety of work settings. The actual setting is determined by the type, size, location and financial resources of the employer, and by the speciality, experience and education of the home economist. Some positions
                                    require evening work and extensive travel.
